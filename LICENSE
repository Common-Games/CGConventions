Personal use, Educational use, Corporate use, and all other uses EXCEPT Illegal or Military are OK! Limiting how you can use something free would make us a cunt, But using our free code for making SkyNet would make *you* a cunt.

The repository/site you obtained this software from should contain a way for you to contact me. Contributing to open source makes you awesome!

Not doing so would make you a cunt.
